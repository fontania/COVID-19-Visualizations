# Coronavirus and cases and deaths by county

Below are the number of cases and the number of deaths per county.

{% include cases_by_county.html %}
{% include deaths_by_county.html %}

# Coronavirus cases and deaths per 100,000 people

The above maps can be misleading. The large number of cases are often at population centers. Looking at the number of cases per 100,000 people is a more relative metric that shows how a county is impacted relative to its population.
